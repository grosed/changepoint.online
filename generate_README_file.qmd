# `changepoint_online`

## **A Collection of Methods for Online Changepoint Detection**

The changepoint_online package provides efficient algorithms for detecting changes in data streams, based on the `Focus` algorithm. The `Focus` algorithm solves the CUSUM likelihood-ratio test exactly in $O(\log(n))$ time per iteration, where n represents the current iteration. The method is equivalent to running a rolling window (MOSUM) simultaneously for all sizes of windows or the Page-CUSUM for all possible values of the size of change (an infinitely dense grid).

**Key Features**

-   Contains all `Focus` exponential family algorithms as well as the `NPFocus` algorithm for non-parametric changepoint detection.

-   It's versatile enough to be applied in scenarios where the pre-change parameter is either known or unknown.

-   It is possible to apply constraints to detect specific types of changes (such as increases or decreases in parameter values).

## Installation

### using pip

#### installing from PyPI

```         
pip install changepoint-online
```

#### installing from github with pip

```         
python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/grosed/changepoint_online/#egg=changepoint_online&subdirectory=python/package'
```

## Examples

### Simple Gaussian Change-in-mean

```{python}
from changepoint_online import Focus, Gaussian
import numpy as np

# generating some data with a change at 50,000
np.random.seed(0)
Y = np.concatenate((np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=50000), np.random.normal(loc=2.0, scale=1.0, size=5000)))

# initialize a Focus Gaussian detector
detector = Focus(Gaussian())
threshold = 13.0

for y in Y:
    # update your detector sequentially with
    detector.update(y)
    if detector.statistic() >= threshold:
        break

print(detector.changepoint())
```

If the pre-change location is known (in case of previous training data), this can be specified with:

```{python}
# initialize a Focus Gaussian detector (with pre-change location known)
detector = Focus(Gaussian(loc=0))
threshold = 13.0

for y in Y:
    # update your detector sequentially with
    detector.update(y)
    if detector.statistic() >= threshold:
        break

print(detector.changepoint())
```

See `help(FamilyName)` for distribution specific parameters, e.g. `help(Gaussian)`.

### Change in one-parameter exponential family distributions

As in the Gaussian case, we can detect:

-   Poisson change-in-rate

-   Gamma change-in-scale (or rate). Exponential change-in-rate implemented as a Gamma `shape=1`.

-   Bernoulli change-in-probability

For example:

```{python}
from changepoint_online import Focus, Gamma
import numpy as np 

np.random.seed(0)
Y = np.concatenate((np.random.gamma(4.0, scale=3.0, size=50000), 
                    np.random.gamma(4.0, scale=6.0, size=5000)))

# initialize a Gamma change-in-scale detector (with shape = 4)
detector = Focus(Gamma(shape=4.0))
threshold = 12.0
for y in Y:
    detector.update(y)
    if detector.statistic() >= threshold:
        break
        
print(detector.changepoint())
```

### Non-Parametric changepoint detection

If we do not know the underlying distribution, or if the nature of the change is unkown *a priori,* we can then use `NPFocus`.

```{python}
from changepoint_online import NPFocus
import numpy as np

# Define a simple Gaussian noise function
def generate_gaussian_noise(size):
    return np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=size)

# Generate mixed data with change in gamma component
gamma_1 = np.random.gamma(4.0, scale=3.0, size=5000)
gamma_2 = np.random.gamma(4.0, scale=6.0, size=5000)
gaussian_noise = generate_gaussian_noise(10000)
Y = np.concatenate((gamma_1 + gaussian_noise[:5000], gamma_2 + gaussian_noise[5000:]))

# Create and use NPFocus detector
## One needs to provide some quantiles to track the null distribuition over
quantiles = [np.quantile(Y[:100], q) for q in [0.25, 0.5, 0.75]]
## the detector can be initialised with those quantiles
detector = NPFocus(quantiles)

stat_over_time = []

for y in Y:
    detector.update(y)
    # we can sum the statistics over to get a detection
    # see  (Romano, Eckley, and Fearnhead 2024) for more details
    if np.sum(detector.statistic()) > 25:
        break


changepoint_info = detector.changepoint()
print(changepoint_info["stopping_time"])
```
